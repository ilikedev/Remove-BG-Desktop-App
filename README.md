# Remove-BG-Desktop-App
SOURCE CODE IS IN "beta2" BRANCH
## Description
An application that is used to remove the background of images simply by operating via the Remove.bg API.

However, this tool is currently only available in French. This is why I plan to make an English version which will automatically translate according to the language of your bone.

This application requires Python to work. <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp?hl=fr-fr&gl=us&referrer=storeforweb&source=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.microsoft.com%2Fdetail%2F9ncvdn91xzqp%3Fhl%3Den-us%26gl%3DUS&productid=9ncvdn91xzqp&ocid=storeweb-pdp-open-cta">Download Python</a>
